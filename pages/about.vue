    <h1>Design is an iterative process. The greatest ideas donâ€™t come from purely inventing things, its about delevoping
      exsting products in specific directions and to rethink if they still match their purpose from time to time. The
      biggest enemy of design? habits. People tend to do things as they are used to do, even if there are better ways to
      solve a problem. And often habits are good, they protect us from chaos and give us stucture, but sometimes we have
      to reconsider them to achieve our next level. </h1>
